Hello reader! Adrian here, the editor of this blog. In this article, I will describe the daily routine that I’ve been following for about 5 years. 
It’s not the silver bullet in terms of wellness and well-being, but it worked for my body and mind.

Slow mornings … are the best. I’m lucky to be a morning person who wakes up without an alarm around 5:30 AM. 
Sometimes late, but usually around this hour. The first thing is to hydrate with flat or mineral water and prepare for the morning run. 

Because I’m living near the sea, I can be on the beach in about 5 minutes or so. 
For this, I prefer to run over natural surfaces like sand and less on concrete or roads. 
Sometimes I can see the sunrise, but this depends on the time of the year.
